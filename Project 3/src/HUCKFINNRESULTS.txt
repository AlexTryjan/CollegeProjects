\f0\fs24 \cf0 I used the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain for testing purposes as I really enjoyed this book when I was little.\
\
mostCommonCollocs(10, \'93Huck\'94, 1) returns the top ten right collocations of the word \'93Huck\'94\
\
finn, and, but, well, i, no, takes, stealing, creeps, the\
\
Aside from his name (finn),  the other words are primarily basic English \'91link\'92 words like i, the, and and. This was expected, so I ran the test again using exceptions in the form of a lot of basic words.\
\
mostCommonCollocs(10, \'93Huck\'94, 1, new String[] 
\fs22 \{"I","and","the","a","but","no","well","its", "what", "it\'94\})\
\
return top 10 collocations without the words in the array exceptions\
\
finn, takes, stealing, creeps, aen, decided, loses, finds, explains, parting\
\
\'93aen\'94 is most likely due to the poor grammar that is accredited to some parts of the novel (individuals who don\'92t have an extensive knowledge of the english language as in Jim).\
\
mostCommonWords(10) returns the top ten words in the novel\
\
and, the, a ,to, i, it, was, of, he, in\
\
This result is to be expected as these words are all standard to traditional English writings.\
\
mostCommonWordPairs(10) returns top ten word pairs in the novel\
\
in the, of the, and the, it was, and i, i was, and then, to the, on the, out of\
\
Again, the common word pairs are filled with common English base words such as the and i.\
\
The wordRank() and wordPairRank() methods calculated \'93Huck\'94 and \'93Huck Finn\'94 respectively. \'93Huck\'94 was ranked 189. \'93Huck Finn\'94 was ranked 751.
